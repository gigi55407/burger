# burger    

Burger is an application that lists burgers that are available to eat under Burgers Not Devoured and burgers that have been eaten under
Burgers Devoured. Each burger under Burgers Not Devoured has a button next to it which, when clicked, moves the burger to the Burgers Devoured list. 

In the middle of the web page, between the two lists, is a section where the user can enter the name of a new burger. When the user clicks Submit, the burger is displayed under Burgers Not Devoured, until the user clicks on the Eat Burger button and it is moved to the Burgers Devoured list.
